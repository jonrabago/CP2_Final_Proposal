# CP2_Final_Proposal
## Summary
What I would like to do is utilize the face detection software to emulate a user's face with simple shapes and colors. For example oval face, circle eyes, triangle nose, hexagonal lips, etc. and the colors randomly generated. I hope this creates Picasso-like images of every individual's profile.

## Component/Parts
* PoseNet
* Recognizition of facial dimentions (anchor points)

## Challenges
My inexpertice in coding but I will try my best because I want to learn how to code.

## Timeline
* **Week 4:**   Start experimenting with the code of lines to figure out what is what.
* **Week 5:**   Start manipulating codes of line to see what can work in my favor.
* **Week 6:**   Attempt to make simple shapes follow their respected facial attributes.
* **Week 7:**   Make the shapes random colors that follow a specific hue and saturation.
* **Week 8:**   Try to figure out how to make it fit the shape of the facial parts.
* **Week 9:**   Try to figure out how to make it fit the shape of the facial parts.
* **Week 10:**  Create a background with random shapes.
* **Week 11:**  Make sure to perfect my project.
* **Week 12:**  Try to get feedback on how to improve it.
* **Week 14:**  Final Critique!
