# Paper Fortune Teller

I propose to build an interactive paper fortune teller game like the one we used to play in elementary school.

## Summary

The paper fortune teller game will run on CodeSandBox and will play similarly to the train/ship interactive game. The game will ask the player to chose between different colors and numbers, an animation then opening and closing to the selected color's number of leters and number they choose until it reveals your future prediction. There will be various pathways the game will take you---just like in real life.

The main goal of the project is to create a fun and nostalgic we all remember from our childhood in order to bring back happy memories and distract us from our current situation. The game might also be able to take you out of your worries by giving you a prediction you were hoping for.


## Component Parts

On the software side, I will be using CodeSandbox to code the game into fruition---creating the prospective page for each selection to deliver the player to their prediction. I will also be using Adobe Photoshop to create the many variations of the paper fortune teller's motions and predictions.

## Challenges

It has been a while since I have coded, so it will take me a bit to get back to where I was, though where I was was still not as good as I would want to be. I will also need to research ways to integrate gif images and make it go to the next page once the paper fotune teller has finished animating. I will also have to build a live prototype of the fortune teller to accurately illustrate it and its movement.

## Timeline

What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks?

- Week 1: Come up with some ideas and finalise the proposal.
- Week 2: Create prototype of the fortune teller and sketch out the movements.
- Week 3: illustrate the different frames of the animations and export them to diffrent gif files.
- Week 4: Learn how to import gifs and code the sandbox game.
- Week 5: Present complete project.
